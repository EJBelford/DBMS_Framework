	    There are two ways to locate an existing PCD.  The first is to 
choose a contract or program that the PCD belongs to from

 PCDs that were created in the current year for that contract or 
program.  If the PCD has not yet 
		been approved, you can check the box at the top of the screen for the 
state that the PCD is in and click the "Refresh List" button. 
		This will show all of the current year's PCDs that are in the checked 
states. To show PCDs that were created in all years and are in the 
checked states, click the "Show all Years" button.
		When the "Show all Years" button is clicked, the button label changes 
to "Show Current Year".  At that point, you can click the "Show Current 
Year" button to see PCDs that were created in the current year and have 
the checked states.<br>
		The second way to find an existing PCD is to search for it.  On the 
main page there is a link on the top of the screen labeled "Search". 
		Clicking on that link will direct you to a page where you can enter 
and search on any details of a PCD.  Clicking the search button 
		will then display a list of all PCDs meeting that criteria.

  </b>
</h1>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Program Control Directive (PCD) application handles
the generating, routing, approving and filing/archiving  of Program Control
Directives (PCD’s).&nbsp;&nbsp;PCD’s are used by the Program Office to
direct and authorize personnel to perform actions outside normal circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Common actions are to procure certain pieces of hardware, loan items to
other facilities temporarily, and to stop work on a specific workpackage
until requirements are clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently the principal user is
the Lockheed Martin Manassas Navy Systems Program Office.
